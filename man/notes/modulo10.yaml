title     : Check digit generation by Modulo 10 recursive
readme    : OPTIONAL_README_CONTENTS
contents  :

    The QR reference consists of 27 positions and is numerical. The last position (on the right) is occupied by a check digit (P).

    The use of check digit generation in the reference prevents errors in the order entry by the debtor.

    Modulo 10 recursive must be used to generate the check digit. The recursive schema for calculating the QR reference consists
    of using Modulo10 to keep separating off the next digit of the 26 digit reference until the number only consists of one
    digit.

    The sequence of numbers to be checked is processed from left to right. For the first digit the carry-forward = 0.

    The number to be checked corresponds to the column number, and the carryforward to the line number in the table. The combined
    value of both produces the carry-forward for the next digit in the sequence.

    ### Example

    Input
    :   Sequence of digits 21000000000313947143000901 (positions 1 to 26 of the 27-digit QR reference)

    Rules
    :   ![Check digit calculation example](qrbill-18.jpg)

          - Commence with carry-over 0 and combine with 1st digit of row 2, resulting in a value or carry-over of 4.
          - Carry-over 4 combined with 2nd digit of row 1 results in a combination or carry-over of 2.
          - etc.
          - Carry-over 7 combined with last digit of row 1 results in a combination or carry-over of 3.
          - The value in the last column in the extension of carry-over 3 is the check digit = 7.

    Output
    :   Sequence of digits 21 00000 00003 13947 14300 09017 (positions 1 to 27 of the 27-digit QR reference)
