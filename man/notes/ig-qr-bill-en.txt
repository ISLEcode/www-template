Introduction to the QR-bill

The payment slips used in Switzerland go back over a hundred years and are used 100 million times a year.
The increasing regulatory requirements for payment traffic make some system modifications necessary, in particular a review of data management. Payment traffic must also take account of digital structural changes in business and society, without forgetting those groups of the population who make payments over the post office counter or by post.
The QR-bill is replacing the existing multiplicity of payment slips in Switzerland and so is helping to increase efficiency and simplify payment traffic, at the same time offering a way of dealing with the challenges presented by digitalisation and regulation.
The following illustration shows a schematic basic process in the Swiss payment traffic based on a QR-bill. Its purpose is to outline synchronized scopes of application of various Implementation Guidelines and business rules:

Figure 1:

Basic process

This basic process is intended for basic understanding and does not represent any complete presentation of all possible constellations. There are also other use cases which vary slightly from it (e.g. where the payer and the debtor are different; the


Introduction

payment part with receipt is used for a donation; debtor is unknown when the payment is set up). We will not go into those any further here.
The basic process comprises the following steps: the biller generates a QR-bill with a payment part and receipt and sends it to the bill recipient. It is usually sent on paper or digitally as a PDF document. The bill recipient (who in this case is also the debtor) can now trigger the payment using various payment channels, for example:  M-banking  E-banking  Paper payment instruction sent to their bank  Cash inpayment at post office counter (branches and branches with a partner
company)  Entering a payment order in their institution's own infrastructure (e.g. ERP
software) The data contained in the QR-code serves as an aid in filling in the data so that no manual entries are required. Alternatively, data can be entered manually based on the textual information.
Complying with the requirements stated in this document will ensure that payments sent via any payment channel can be executed reliably.
In addition to various Swiss Implementation Guidelines governing customer-bank data exchange based on the ISO 20022 standard (e.g. for credit transfers, cash management), the following documents are also relevant to QR-bills:  Style Guide QR-bill (summary of layout rules from this document)  Processing rules for QR-bills (Business Rules)  Technical information about the QR-IID and QR-IBAN  Bank Master (list of IIDs and QR IIDs of banks)
The «~Processing rules for QR-bills» describe the relevant technical processing stages. The «~Technical information on the QR-IID and QR-IBAN» provides detailed information about the use of the QR-IBAN based on a QR-IID.

Versioning of the Swiss Implementation Guidelines QR-bill

The main versions place the versioning counter in the first position. (Version 1.0; Version 2.0). Main versions can either have an impact on the data structure, the content or on the design recommendations, and generally require technical adaptations.
Subversions (Version 1.1; Version 1.11) generally do not require any technical adaptations.
The version must be depicted in the data structure (for details see 4.3 «~Data structure», «~Version» element).

Swiss Implementation Guidelines QR-bill

Annex E: Guidelines for syntax definitions in the «~Billing information» and «~Alternative procedures» fields in the QR-bill

The field «~Billing information» supports automation of debtor's accounts payable. A user group interested in using the field, e.g. a business sector, may add here the information of creditor on the invoice, such as VAT number, VAT amount, date on which the service was provided, etc. The definition of structure and data content is, with few restrictions, at the discretion of the relevant user group.
The «~Alternative procedures» field contains information necessary to convert a QR-bill into another procedure (e.g. eBill: Requires an e-mail address of the debtor). The definition of structure and data content is, with few restrictions, at the discretion of the relevant service provider.
Target groups
This guide is dedicated to invoice senders and recipients as well as their industry associations which want to use the «~Billing information» field in the QR-bill. The description of the «~Alternative procedures» field is dedicated to service providers in the Swiss payment traffic which convert the QR-bills into a form wished by their customers.

Purpose
This guide describes the process for defining, implementing and invalidating syntax definitions for the «~Billing information» and «~Alternative procedures» fields.

Delimitation
The specifications of relevant fields are to be found in the main section of the Implementation Guidelines for the QR-bill (cf. Chapter 4.4). This process description is limited to the presentation of the syntax definition life cycle.

Table 21:

Data elements in the field Billing information, example of Swico

Rules The separators // are prescribed by SIX. They are intended to identify the beginning of billing information (structured information for the invoice sender) when it is printed on the visible part. The /nn/ tags must be filled in in ascending order. Each tag may only be given once. A tag with no data can be omitted. A tag with no data is the equivalent of an omitted tag. The length of the value for any tag is not directly limited. The «~Unstructured message» and «~Structured information from the biller» fields must not contain more than 140 characters in total. Field content may not contain the characters «~/» and «\»; these must be replaced by «\/» and «\\» (Escape). An amount or a percentage with decimal places must use the character «~.» (full stop) as the separator. Numbers smaller than 1 are presented with a leading zero (e.g. «~0.~»). Dates are formatted as YYMMDD (year, month, day). Fields including more than one data element in a list use the character «~;» (semicolon) as a separator.

Table 22:

Rules for the field Billing information, example of Swico

Information such as amount and currency is contained in dedicated fields in the data set of the QR code, so it is not sent in the «~Billing information ».
Fields /11/  The voucher date is the same as the date of the invoice; it is used as the reference date for
the terms and conditions.  Together with the field /40/0:n, a maturity date of the invoice can be calculated (payable
within n days after the voucher date). /20/  The customer reference is a reference sent by the customer and is used to identify the bill.

/30/  The VAT number is the same as the numerical UID of the service provider (without the CHE prefix, separator and VAT suffix).
 The VAT number can be used by the bill recipient to identify the biller unambiguously. All billers who have a UID should enter it here, even if the other VAT fields are omitted.
 For a bill with more than one VAT number, the first should be entered.
/31/  The VAT date can either be the date on which the service was provided or the start and end date of the service (e.g. for a subscription).
 If the document refers to several services with different dates of delivery, the /31/ field must be omitted (enter manually).
/32/  The VAT details refer to the invoiced amount, excluding any discount.  VAT details contain either: ­ a single percentage that is to be applied to the whole invoiced amount or ­ a list of the VAT amounts, defined by a percentage rate and a net amount; the colon «~:» is used as the separator.  The net amount is the net price (excluding VAT) on which the VAT is calculated.  If a list is given, the total of the net amounts and the VAT calculated on them must correspond to the amount in the QR Code.
/33/  Where goods are imported, the import tax can be entered in this field. The amount is the VAT amount.
 The rate serves correct recording of VAT in the accounts.  This makes it easier for the bill recipient to record the VAT in the case of an import.
/40/  The terms and conditions may refer to a discount or list of discounts.  The voucher date /11/ counts as the reference date.  Each discount is defined by a percentage and a deadline (in days); the colon «~:» is used as the separator.  The indication with a percentage rate equal to zero defines the default payment date of the invoice (e.g. «~0:~» for 30 days net). Attention: when this day is used, at least the default payment date of the invoice should be indicated. Without this indication, the payment software will not be able to suggest any date for the payment.
