    body  : The following rules apply for payment instructions to financial institutions as well as to payments at post office
            counters (branches and branches with partner organisations). They relate to their solutions for reading from the Swiss
            QR Code and further processing. This especially applies for scanning solutions (physical payment instructions) as well
            as for mobile end devices (M-banking). Producers of software solutions must adhere to these rules in order to enable
            smooth processing.

            Before the further processing of the values read from the Swiss QR Code, individual field contents that are listed in
            the Implementation Guidelines must be checked. This means that:

              - The content must match a valid value; this applies for QRType, the version, the coding type and the currency.

              - The general specifications according to part 4.2 «~Technical specifications» must be adhered to.

              - The value must be syntactically correct; this applies for the amount (if entered).

              - The permitted combinations of account with reference type (IBAN only with «~SCOR~» [Creditor Reference] or «~NON~»
                [optional free text information]; QR-IBAN with «~QRR~» [QR reference]) must be used.
