  - name  : QR-bill
    desc  : |-
            The «~QR-bill » is understood to mean  a bill with a payment part and receipt integrated in the form, and  a bill
            with a separately enclosed payment part and receipt.

            The following figure serves a sketch of two possible designs of a QR-bill with payment part, intended to improved
            comprehension of the subsequent definitions.

            ![Schematic depiction of a QR-bill with integrated payment part/receipt and with payment part/receipt as an
            enclosure](qrbill-02.jpg)

  - name  : Payment part with Swiss QR code and receipt
    desc  : |-
            The payment part of the QR-bill with receipt contains the information that is required to execute the payment in the
            form of a QR code and also as readable information.

            The receipt must be on the left of the payment part, regardless of whether it is integrated in the bill or on a
            separate sheet of paper.

            The payment part is in DIN-A6 landscape format (148 mm x 105 mm). The receipt to the left of the payment part measures
            62 mm x 105 mm, so the two together measure 210 mm x 105 mm.

  - name  : QR Code according to ISO 18004
    desc  : |-
            The QR Code is a two-dimensional barcode, in accordance with ISO 18004, based on the development of the company DENSO
            WAVE INCORPORATED. «~QR Code » is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED.

            The QR Code standard stipulates versions for the coding of various data volumes (from Version 1 to Version 40) with
            correspondingly different storage capacities in the form of modules. The respective codeable data volume depends, on
            the one hand, on the error correction level chosen, and on the other, on the data to be encoded (numeric,
            alphanumeric, binary, Kanji).

            A fixed number of modules is allocated to each version.

  - name  : The term «~module » according to ISO 18004
    desc  : A module designates the smallest information carrier in the QR Code, comparable with a data bit. In the QR Code the
            modules correspond to the white and black dots of the code.

  - name  : The term «~error correction level» according to ISO 18004
    desc  : The QR Code has the ability to restore the data contained in the code if the code is damaged (e.g. through dirt,
            folding, imprinting). The standard includes four error correction levels corresponding to different restoration
            capacities (L = approx. 7%, M = approx. 15%, Q = approx. 25%, H = approx. 30%). The higher the error correction level
            that is chosen, the lower the codeable data volume.

  - name  : Swiss QR Code
    desc  : |-
            The Swiss QR Code complies with the specifications in this document and enables payments to be triggered by financial
            institutions across all payment channels and at post office counters (at branches and branches of a partner company).
            It is marked with a Swiss cross in the middle.

            ![Swiss QR Code](qrbill-03.jpg)

  - name  : DPI
    desc  : The printer and scanner resolution are customarily specified in Dots per Inch (DPI).

  - name  : IID
    desc  : The IID (institution identification) is used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein to identify financial institutions as
            participants in the Swiss RTGS systems. Every institution is assigned at least one IID.

  - name  : QR-IID
    desc  : The QR-IID is derived from the institutional identification (IID). QR-IIDs consist exclusively of numbers from 30000
            to 31999. IBANs (QR-IBANs) based on these QRIIDs are used only for the new procedure with a QR reference in the
            QR-bill (see also paragraph 2.11).

  - name  : IBAN
    desc  : The IBAN is the internationally standardised representation of a bank account number in accordance with the ISO 13616
            standard.

  - name  : QR-IBAN
    desc  : For payments with a structured QR reference, the QR-IBAN must be used to indicate the account to be credited. The
            formal structure of the QR-IBAN corresponds to the rules stipulated in ISO 13616 standard for IBAN. The payment
            scheme with reference is recognized through a special financial institution identification (QR-IID). The values 30000
        —   — 31999 are exclusively reserved for the QR-IID. Each legally independent financial institution participating in the
            scheme is assigned one QR-IID. The QR-IBAN contains the QR-IID of the account-keeping financial institution for
            identification of the scheme. Detailed information about the QR-IID and QR-IBAN can be found in the «~Technical
            information on the QR-IID and QR-IBAN» document [6]. The latest version can be downloaded at www.paymentstandards.ch.

  - name  : Customer references
    desc  : |-
            For payments with structured reference, the two following reference types are used.

            QR reference
            : The structure of the QR reference corresponds to that of the ISR reference (26 numerical characters followed by a
              Modulo 10 recursive check digit, see Annex B «~Check digit generation by Modulo 10 recursive») and can be used by
              the biller as a structured reference.

            Creditor Reference
            : Creditor Reference according to the ISO 11649 standard.
