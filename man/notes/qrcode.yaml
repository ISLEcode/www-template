  - name  : Error correction level
    level : 1
    body  : The code generation must take place with error correction level «~M~», which means a redundancy or assurance of
            around 15%.

  - name  : Maximum data range and QR code version
    level : 1
    body  : The maximum Swiss QR Code data content permitted is 997 characters (including the element separators). The version of
            the QR Code resulting with error correction level «~M~» and binary coding is version 25 with 117 x 117 modules.

  - name  : Minimum module size
    level : 1
    body  : To guarantee the secure scanning of the Swiss QR Code, a minimum module size of 0.4 mm is recommended for printing.

  - name  : Measurements of the Swiss QR Code for printing
    level : 1
    body  : |-
            The measurements of the Swiss QR Code for printing must always be 46 x 46 mm (without surrounding quiet space)
            regardless of the Swiss QR Code version. Depending on the printer resolution, the Swiss QR Code produced must be
            enlarged or reduced accordingly. This must occur on the basis of a vector graphic in order to maintain the quality of
            the Swiss QR Code.

  - name  : Ruhezone gemäss ISO 18004
    level : 2
    body  : To ensure the readability of the Swiss QR Code, an unprinted border must be provided around the Swiss QR Code
            corresponding to the width of four modules (corresponds to >= 1.6 mm). In the design recommendations, this border was
            expanded to five mm to improve user-friendliness (see 3.5.2 «~Swiss QR Code section~»).

  - name  : Recognition characters
    level : 2
    body  : |-
            To increase the recognizability and differentiation for users, the Swiss QR Code created for printout is to be
            overlaid with a Swiss cross logo measuring 7 x 7 mm.

            A corresponding file with the logo can be downloaded from the website's download section at www.PaymentStandards.CH.

  - name  : The payment amount
    level : 2
    body  : |-
            The «~Amount~» element is to be entered without leading zeroes, including decimal separators and with two decimal
            places. The «~.~» symbol is to be used as a decimal separator.

            The «~Amount~» element need not be filled in the Swiss QR Code.
