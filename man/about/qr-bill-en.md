## The QR-bill: Efficiency Squared. {#the-qr-bill-efficiency-squared. .section_title}

The QR-bill will modernize Swiss payment transactions. It will brought into circulation from 30 June 2020 and replace current
payment slips after a transition phase still to be defined. The QR-bill consists of a payment section and a receipt. All relevant
information required for automatic and consequently efficient payment and book entry is included in Swiss QR Code.

The QR-bill and its digital possibilities will completely simplify payments. The benefits are clear:\

-   **Convenient:** the QR code is very easy to scan.
-   **Swift:** one click is enough to trigger payment.
-   **Efficient:** there is no need to type the account and reference numbers -- making payment faster and reducing errors.

## Three Options For Paying a QR-bill Easily. {#three-options-for-paying-a-qr-bill-easily. .section_title}

### Via mobile banking {#via-mobile-banking .paragraph_title}

Open the mobile banking app on your smartphone, scan the Swiss QR Code with the QR reader function and tap the screen to trigger
payment.\

### Via e-banking {#via-e-banking .paragraph_title}

Open e-banking, scan the Swiss QR Code with the QR reader or your PC camera and click to trigger payment.\

### By mail {#by-mail .paragraph_title}

The QR-bill works like an existing payment slip and can be paid either at a Swiss Post branch, at a branch with partner or by
payment order in an envelope to the bank.

And of course it is also quick and easy if you are using a business software. Bring it up to date! This ensures that the QR-bills
will be actually paid.

## Ready For the QR-bill! {#ready-for-the-qr-bill .section_title}

Swiss banks will adapt their mobile banking and e-banking solutions promptly on 30 June 2020 to ensure you will be able to scan
your QR-bills easily in future -- regardless of whether you are acting as a private individual or on behalf of a company.\

## Fit For the QR-bill? {#fit-for-the-qr-bill .section_title}

In the event that you have not yet 'gone digital', get fit for the QR-bill and use online banking of your financial institution.
You will then be able to pay your QR-bills easily using e-banking at your home computer or by mobile banking when you are out and
about.\

## The QR-bill -- Briefly Explained. {#the-qr-bill-briefly-explained. .section_title}

-   Just like existing payment slips, the QR-bill is divided into two parts -- into a receipt** (1)** and a payment
    section **(2)**.
-   The Swiss QR Code **(3)** contains all relevant information needed both for invoicing and for payment.
-   The perforation **(4)** means that you can easily separate the payment section and the receipt from the invoice and either pay
    it into the post office, just as you did before, or send it to your bank with the payment order by mail.

#### What to do when you get a QR-bill without amount or without name and address? {#what-to-do-when-you-get-a-qr-bill-without-amount-or-without-name-and-address .paragraph_title}

Enter the missing data manually.

## Further information {#further-information .section_title}

This is where you will find more information about the QR-bill -- in your language and in a form that is easily downloadable.\

### FAQs Regarding the QR-bill. {#faqs-regarding-the-qr-bill. .chapter_title}

When can the QR-bill be used?

The date of introduction is 30 June 2020. From this date on:

-   Invoice recipients must be able to pay QR-bills
-   Invoice issuers may dispatch QR-bills.

Am I free to decide whether to continue using the red and orange payment slips or to use the QR-bill for invoicing?

Following a period in which both systems operate in parallel, which will be as short as possible, we shall stop processing the
current orange and red payment slips. From this date, you will only be able to use the QR-bill for invoicing.\

Can the payment section be used for paper-based payment orders?

Yes, as is customary today with the red and orange payment slips, the payment section can also be attached to a payment order in
paper form in future.\

How can the payment section be used for online services?

With the payment information contained in the QR code, you will be able to trigger payments in e-/m-banking or incorporate
alternative payment methods such as eBill.\
\

Can the payment section be used for paying in cash at the post office?

The payment section must be separated from the QR-bill. Then the payment section can be used for payment at the post office
counter or at sub-post offices. The receipt can also be used to confirm payments.\
\

Can the QR-bill be used for paper-based payment orders to the bank?

The payment section must be separated from the QR-bill. Then the payment section (minus the receipt) can be attached to a payment
order in paper form.\
\

How can the benefits of the QR-bill be used most efficiently?

Anybody who uses e-banking or mobile banking will benefit most from the QR-bill. The Swiss QR Code can be easily scanned with a QR
reader or the PC camera and the payment executed with a single click.\
\

What information is included in the Swiss QR Code?

The QR code contains all relevant details re the payment recipient and payer, amount, currency etc. A complete list is provided in
the "Swiss Implementation Guidelines QR-bill".\
\

Will people without technical knowledge be disadvantaged by the introduction of the Swiss QR Code?

No. People will still be able to record payment orders in e-/m-banking and present the invoices at the post office
counter/sub-post offices or as payment orders at the bank, just as they can today.\
\

What do I have to do to pay a QR-bill at a bank or post office counter?

Exactly the same as today with the payment slips: separate them neatly from the bill and show them at the counter.

Will the debtor have to pay the fees for post office counter payments himself in future?

No, the fee logic of PostFinance will not change. This means that the fees will continue to be debited to the creditor account.

How to scan the Swiss QR Code?

Your house bank will allow you to scan the Swiss QR Code via your e-banking or m-banking mask (e.g. with your smartphone camera).
For counter payments, the scanning is done on the spot.

Can the invoice recipient view the data stored in the Swiss QR Code to compare it with the visible part?

Yes, many QR code readers are available for free on the Internet. In addition, after scanning, the payment data is displayed in
your e-banking or mobile banking application.

Will the Swiss QR Code restrict use of current payment transaction channels?

No. All payment transaction channels will remain in use. All the information included therein will be printed on the payment
section; it can also be read with the naked eye, i.e. without technical equipment. This means that payments can still be recorded
manually in e-/m-banking without any additional infrastructure. The same information is also included in the QR code. This also
means payers can automate their recording. In private households, this will be possible primarily through the use of banking apps
on smartphones. 78% of the Swiss population owns one of these phones already. Payers with large numbers of invoices will use
document readers or scanners, which support QR code, for this automation.\
\

Can the QR-bill be used for foreign payments?

A distinction must be made here between payments to Switzerland and payments from Switzerland:

-   Payments from Switzerland to other countries: This is only possible if the invoice issuer, i.e. the payment recipient, offers
    a bank account in Switzerland or Liechtenstein
-   Payments from abroad to Switzerland: We cannot influence whether banks abroad support the QR-bill. There may be corresponding
    offers for Swiss customers in regions close to the border

 

What happens to the previous neutral payment slips?

PostFinance will offer an alternative for inpayments without QR-bill at a Swiss Post branch or at a branch with partner.

What does \"ultimate debtor\" mean and what happens to his data?

An ultimate debtor is a person who receives a QR-bill. Data on the ultimate debtor must be forwarded from the debtor\'s
institution to the creditor\'s institution in accordance with the agreement with the debtor, provided that this data is
transmitted by the debtor in the payment order and no instructions to the contrary or special agreements with the debtor preclude
forwarding.
