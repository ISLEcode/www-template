# SAMinfo client for iPhone

This application is intended to scan QR codes and send them to the SAMinfo ERP.

We are considering either a cross-platform implementation (e.g. [React] or [VueJS] based, see [this][vue1] and [this][vue2]
examples) or in natively supported languages such as [Kotlin] or [Java].
