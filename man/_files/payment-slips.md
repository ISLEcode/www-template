# The QR-bill

Red and orange payment slips soon to be a thing of the past

From June 30, 2020, the new QR-bill will make it easier for you to issue and pay bills. The new bills contain all the payment
information in the QR code and can simply be scanned digitally.

The QR-bill at a glance

-   Simple Create, print out and send bills online or using software
-   Practical The QR code contains all the relevant data and can be scanned and read no matter where you are
-   Flexible Can be used via analog and digital channels -- for creating and paying bills

Benefits for billers

-   Simplified issuing, including across Europe and in euros, thanks to the IBAN format
-   Efficient management of outstanding receivables thanks to the new electronic account reports

Benefits for bill payers

-   Fast payments -- all of the payment information can be scanned and confirmed through the QR code
-   Error-free -- reference numbers and billers no longer have to be entered manually

## How do I switch to QR-billing?

### Biller with own billing software

To start working with QR-bills, your software must not only be able to issue QR-bills, but also to import the new electronic
account reports in camt format. The following points must be noted:

-   Make sure that your billing software supports the versions of the QR-bill you have chosen.

-   If you currently reconcile your open items electronically using the v11 ESR credit file, you must switch your account
    reporting to the new standardized camt format 

    -   camt.053: account statement with internal collective booking details, or
    -   camt.054: separate collective booking details

-   [Information sheet for billers ![pdf, 823 KB]]

-   [To camt account reports]

-   The first six digits of the QR reference must be filled in with the existing BESR-ID as identification number. This prevents
    potential rejections and posting errors at the recipient bank (in case a QR-bill is mistakenly paid as an orange payment
    slip).

-   For printing, use white perforated paper

-   To make your transition to QR-bill as smooth as possible, we invite you to use our free test form before sending your first
    QR-bill. Please send examples of your QR-bills to the following address:

### Billers who order payment slips from UBS

If you do not use your own billing software, we\'ll offer an option to issue QR-bills via the UBS QR portal. More information will
follow here soon.

As a bill payer

If you use payment software, you must be able to process all three QR-bill variants with your software from the introduction date.
Payment files can continue to be delivered via the UBS KeyPort interfaces (EBICS) and E-Banking. The digital payment of QR-bills
will be possible in UBS Digital Banking (E-Banking and Mobile Banking), at a Multimat and using a paper-based order form from June
30, 2020, onwards.

## A brief explanation of the QR-bill

## The three versions of the QR-bill

The difference lies in the use of the IBAN and references.
