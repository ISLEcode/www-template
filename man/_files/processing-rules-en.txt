| Processing rules for QR-bills Rules for producing and processing the payment part with Swiss QR Code and receipt
| Version 1.1, with effect from 29 February 2020

## General Note

Comments and questions about this document can be directed to the respective financial institution or to SIX at the following address support.billing-payments@six-group.com.

## Change control

All changes made to this document and changed or new specifications are listed in the document history with version details, change date and a brief description of the changes made.

## Patent notice

SIX and the responsible project sponsors for the new QR-bill for the Swiss financial center have together carefully reviewed the technical and legal framework conditions for the territory of Switzerland in consultation with specialists and are providing corresponding specifications for a standardized QR-bill («standardization»). The usage possibilities for billing and paying a QR-bill listed below were used as a basis:

-   Payer captures QR code using a reader or camera in e-/m-banking
-   Payer captures QR code using a reader or scanner in their own infrastructure and transmits the payment instruction electronically (e.g. as pain message)
-   Cash inpayment at post office counter (branches and branches with a partner company)
-   Credit transfer instruction form

Further uses of the QR-bill that are not listed, such as payment via an ATM, are also not a component of the standardization. For the commercial technological implementation of the standardization, accepted industry solutions and measures are to be planned by the commercial users.

## Important Notices

Third-party specifications and company-specific functionality do not form part of the standardization process. Individual providers are responsible for finding appropriate solutions. This applies particularly to the option of embedding structural information or content in the «Alternative procedures» fields.
The «Billing information» element can be used for sending structured information between the biller and bill recipient. The layout of the QR-bill includes a data field for this purpose.
Containers for alternative procedures are also provided in the «Alternative procedures» elements. The content and use of such data are the responsibility of the providers of those procedures.
In order for the content of the «Billing information» and «Alternative procedures» fields to be identifiable, SIX is prescribing certain coding. This, and use of the fields at all, must be agreed with SIX before they are published or used (for the process cf. Implementation Guidelines for the QR-bill, Annex E).

## Specifications for the QR-bill

If all the processes involved in producing and processing QR-bills are to work smoothly, the Guidelines for the QR-bill must be observed. The Guidelines for the QR-bill are addressed primarily to the issuers of invoices, but they also apply to financial institutions and their service providers offering their customers payments services based on the QR-bill, the developers of software for invoice issuers and recipients and banks, and all other associated participants in the market.

In particular, the following three documents are relevant to the Guidelines for the QR-bill:

-   Technical and functional specifications for the payment section with Swiss QR Code and receipt (this document).
-   Style Guide QR-bill (summary of layout rules from this document)
-   Processing rules for QR-bills
-   Technical information about the QR-IID and QR-IBAN
-   Bank Master (list of IIDs and QR-IIDs of banks)
-   Swiss Payment Standards (Implementation Guidelines on exchanging of data between customers and banks)
-   Implementation Guidelines for Interbank Messages

Failure to comply with the Guidelines for the QR-bill may result, for example, in

-   it not being possible for the debtor and their financial institution to enter the payment.
-   it not being possible for payments to be executed by the debtor and their financial institution.
-   credits to the biller and their financial institution being booked incorrectly or not at all.
-   laws being violated (e.g. data protection).

SIX Interbank Clearing Ltd assumes no responsibility or liability for the correctness and completeness of the information provided. Likewise, SIX Interbank Clearing Ltd does not offer advice for the specific scope of functionality for systems for using the QR-bill, provides no control mechanisms for technical procedures and offers no guarantee and accepts no liability for the actual mechanical or procedural implementation of the standardization process or of solutions for using and processing QR-bills.

## Delimitation

The «Processing rules for QR-bills» describe the technical rules and associated processes for creating a QR-bill and processing a payment part with Swiss QR Code and receipt as shown in Figure 1: The key parties involved and their activities in relation to QR-bill.
Consequently, this document should be read together with the «Swiss Implementation Guidelines QR-bill» document, which defines the technical and functional specifications for the payment part with Swiss QR Code, and also with the document «Technical information about the QR-IID and QR-IBAN for financial institutions» which contains all the technical information that banks and software companies need in order to introduce and use the QR-IBAN based on the QR-IID, a special bank IID. In the case of any discrepancies or contradictions between these processing rules and the specifications in the Swiss Implementation Guidelines QR-bill, the latter take precedence.
The technical and functional requirements for transfers and cash management and for interbank messages do not form part of this document.
Nor does this document describe individual services (e.g. counter payments, credit orders, forms or notifications).

## Definition of terms

The «QR-bill» is understood to mean

-   a bill with a payment part and receipt integrated in the form (where only the for mat and quality of the paper and the obligation to perforate the receipt apply to the bill),

-   a bill with a separately enclosed payment part and receipt (where the Implementation Guidelines and processing rules for QR-bills apply only to the payment part and receipt).

The following terms and abbreviations that are used in this document are defined in the «Swiss Implementation Guidelines QR-bill» in Section 2:

-   Payment part with Swiss QR Code and receipt
-   QR code according to ISO 18004
-   Swiss QR Code
-   QR-IID
-   IBAN
-   QR-IBAN
-   QR reference
-   Creditor Reference

#   Aids and tools


## Introduction scripts


The introduction scripts for invoice issuers and recipients as well as for financial institutions contain all information relevant for a successful introduction of the QR-bill by the target groups mentioned:

-   migration of red and orange payment slips (IS/ISR) to the QR-bill,
-   checklists for project planning,
-   test cases,
-   sample payment parts.



## Validation portal for the Swiss QR Code



The validation portal (https://qr-validation.iso-payments.ch) can be used for uploading and validating text files and images to check the quality of the content of the Swiss QR Code. The detailed results of the validation process will be produced immediately for each file used.


## Grid for homologation



A grid sheet (PDF) for checking payment parts can be found in the Style Guide on page 24 which is available in the Download Center at www.PaymentStandards.CH.

In particular, the grid sheet can be used to check the positioning of the Swiss QR Code on the payment part.



## QR-IIDs in the SIC/euroSIC test system



A Bank Master containing QR-IIDs is available ­ for test purposes only ­ from the Download Center at www.PaymentStandards.CH.

From summer 2019 the full SIC Platform Release 4.6 (taking effect on 16 November 2019) will be available in the SIC/euroSIC test system. From that time, the QR-IIDs in the test system will also be activated.

The test Bank Master including QR-IIDs makes it possible to simulate the behaviour of the customer-bank interface in detail on a test platform.

A test platform using the test Bank Master can check the conformity of generated customer-to-bank messages (validation) and produce bank-to-customer messages (simulation) complying with Swiss processing rules and the Swiss Implementation Guidelines.

In this way it can be quickly and easily seen whether the ISO messages are being correctly formulated and the data exchange is working from the point of view of ISO processing.


Thanks to these detailed test results and simulations of electronic statements, any possible failures in the banking and customer software can be quickly identified and corrected.

# Transactions in QR-bill

The transactions distinguish between, on the one hand, creating, booking and sending notification and, on the other, paying, booking and sending notification of a QRbill.

## Creating, booking and sending notification

### QR-bill with QR-IBAN

Objective
:   In using the procedure with QR-IBAN and structured QR reference, the biller is trying to make automatic reconciliation of unpaid items (debtors) possible when payments come in by using the reference that is returned. The procedure can also be used for appeals for donations.

Alternative versions
:   The QR-IBAN is used in conjunction with the QR reference (previously the ISR reference number).

    The «Unstructured Message» element can be used in addition to the structured reference.

    _Note_: For the QR-bill with QR-IBAN procedure to be recognized, there must be a QRIBAN present. This requires a QR reference to be entered, and ensures that the reference will be sent back to the creditor. It can only be guaranteed that an additional message from the debtor will be forwarded to the creditor if the debtor enters one.

Booking and sending notification of incoming payments
:   Depending on the facilities of the CR-FI, incoming payments may be booked individually and/or in batches. Notification of credits is sent electronically in accordance with the definitions in the «Swiss Implementation Guidelines for customer-to-bank messages (reports)», on paper or as a PDF file.

    -   Notification of incoming payments from QR-bills will be sent electronically in a bank-to-customer camt.05x message complying with the ISO 20022 standard.

    -   Notification using the ISR credit record Type 3 is not possible for incoming payments from QR-bills with a QR-IBAN and QR reference.

    -   Notification of incoming payments from orange payment slips and incoming payments from payment parts with a QR-IBAN and QR reference can be sent using separate credit advice notes.

    -   Notification of incoming payments from QR-bills with IBAN and Creditor Reference will be delivered by financial institutions in accordance with their facilities to do so.

    -   Notification on paper will still be possible.

### QR-bill with IBAN

Objective
:   By using the procedure with IBAN, the biller is trying to manage his debtors. The procedure can also be used for appeals for donations.

Alternative versions
:   When an IBAN is used, the following two alternatives are possible:

    -   The IBAN is used in conjunction with the Creditor Reference, with or without the «Unstructured message» element
    -   The IBAN without reference is used in conjunction with or without the "Unstructured message" element

    _Note_: It can only be guaranteed that the Creditor Reference and/or the unstructured message from the debtor will be forwarded to the creditor if the debtor enters them.

Booking and giving notification of incoming payments
:   Depending on the facilities of the CR-FI, incoming payments may be booked individually and/or in batches. Notification of credits is sent electronically in accordance with the definitions in the «Swiss Implementation Guidelines for customer-to-bank messages (reports)», on paper or as a PDF file.

## Recording Payment Order

Physical payment order, unstructured
:   The physical payment order, unstructured, includes those payment orders which customers place or submit perhaps by visiting the bank or sending a letter.

Physical payment order, structured
:   The physical payment order, structured, makes it easy to reconcile payments with payment parts.

E-banking
:   E-banking can be used to enter and authorise individual payments and standing orders. Data files can be uploaded in the pain.001 message (Upload).

M-banking
:   M-banking apps enable transfers to be made on the basis of a payment part.

File transfer
:   Payment Connectivity Services are integrated payment transaction solutions for corporate customers and businesses. They enable file transfer between accounting or cash management applications and the financial institution operating the account. Data files can be uploaded in the pain.001 message (Upload).

Booking and sending notification of debits
:   Depending on the facilities of the CR-FI, debits may be booked individually and/or in batches. Notification of debits is sent either electronically in accordance with the definitions in the «Swiss Implementation Guidelines for customer-to-bank messages (reports)», on paper or as a PDF file.

# Processing rules

## Procedure with QR-IBAN

The procedure with QR-IBAN may only be used by agreement with the CR-FI. Where the bill is issued with a QR reference, a QR-IBAN must be used to indicate the account to be credited. When a payment is received from a QR-bill with QR reference, the QR-IBAN should be used as the basis for crediting the relevant customer account. Billers who use QR-bill and want electronic notification must be able to process camt messages. When payments are received from payment parts with a structured reference, or from orange payment slips, notification can be sent both in the same camt message and separately in a camt message/V11 file.

### Continued use of the BISR-ID

The customer identification in the first six positions in the reference (formerly BISR customer identification) will no longer be key to identifying the creditor's account. This means that the reference can be entirely filled in by the biller, apart from the check digit. The BISR-ID (usually 6-digit) can still be used when issuing bills. This means that banks' individual structuring and use of the reference can either continue as it is or be started afresh. Billers can also use other forms of identification number by agreement with their financial institutions.

### ISR participation numbers

PostFinance customers (not banks) with one or more ISR participation numbers (amended as described in Section 5.3) can continue to use these with QR-bill.

## Procedure with IBAN

An IBAN must be used if the QR-bill is to be used for invoicing in the versions "with Creditor Reference" or "without reference".

## Procedural and processing rules

The following binding procedural and processing rules relating to the QR code payment part are described as follows:  Reading the Swiss QR Code and manually entered content from the visible part  Layout rules and recommendations  Comparing data between the scanned Swiss QR Code and the visible part  Manual post-recording

## Data sharing

Processing obligations and the binding nature of documentation are described in the Swiss Payments Rulebook in paragraph 1.8.2.

## Inpayments at physical access points of Swiss Post

### Fees for inpayments and processing payment parts

Current prices are listed at www.postfinance.ch.

### Blank payment parts/substitute payment slips

As at least the creditor and other information must be precaptured in a QR-bill payment part, the banks or post may not issue blank payment parts.


## Reading the Swiss QR Code and manually entered content from the visible part

The following table lists the processing rules that apply when scanning the Swiss QR Code and if necessary manually filling in the content of the «Amount» and «Payable by» fields. The rules apply to the channels used by financial institutions (physical processing and m-banking). For debtor solutions, rules/recommendations are only listed where necessary. The following table describes and defines the standard. More liberal or more restrictive applications may also be defined.
